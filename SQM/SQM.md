Quality : Quality is how well a system functions, it varies with perspective.
    Functional view :
        - how well the functions works
        - developers or users view
        - Quality at each requirement
    Non Functional view
        - Business view
        - How good the product attract revenue.

David Garwin's 5 views :
    - Transcendental View : Immediately recognizable but cannot explicitly define.
    - Users view : product fulfills user's view
    - Manufacturer's view : conforms or exceeds specification
    - Product view : compared with general product standard
    - value-based view : how much valuable it is for the customer.

Software Quality : An effective software process applied in a manner that creates a useful product that provides measurable value for those who producr it and those who use it.

McCall's SQ factors :
    Catagories :
        - Product operation factors : 
            correctness, operatability, reliability, efficiency, integrity and usability.
        - Product revision factor : 
            Its ability to undergo change : maintainability, flexibility, Testability
        - Product transition factors:
            Adaptability to new environments : Portability, Reusability and interoperability.

Achieving Software Quality :
    - Software engineering methods
    - Project management techniques
    - Quality Control
    - Quality Assurance

Software engineering Methods :
    - Sound practices used through all phases of SDLC
    - Completed understanding of the problem.
    - Comprehensive design
    - constructive code : applying best practices.
    - comprehensive testing.
    - Deployment strategies.
    - Effective documentation

Project management techniques : ( not much focused)
    - time estimation
    - risk analysis
    - Human centric : keeping developers efficient.

Quality Control :
    - Have quality goals
    - Intermediate products developed to contribute to final product :
        SRS documentation
        Use case diagram
        Quality specification
        code test review

Quality Assurance :
    - Solid engineering methods
    - Rational project management
    - Quality control actions
    - Enable data availability to quantify quality.

# CS 3

Measuring Quality Attributes
    - identify main Attributes
    - identify sub Attributes

Umbrella Activities : 
    Activities to be executed on all generic activities.
    - Software project tracking and control : allows manage any delay
    - Risk management : Assess the risk that could affect the project quality
    - Software quality assurance : Defines and conducts activities required to ensure software quality
    - Technical reviews : Review to reduce bugs
    - Measurement : process, project and product measurement needs to assist software fulfillment.
    - Software configuration management : Manages effect of change through software process.
    - Reusability Management : maximizing software reuse.
    - Work product preparation : Work products like models, documents, logs.
Generic framework Activities :
    - Communication
    - Planning
    - Modeling
    - Construction
    - Deployment

Software Process Models :
    Perspective process model :
        - Detailed execution of 5 generic Activities
        - intented to make projects more manageable
        - better cost estimates
        - achieve required project schedule and quality
        - Carry out process more systematically.
    Agile Process Model :
        - Informal approach to software process model
        - Emphasis on Adaptability
        - Minimal software engineering work products

Perspective Software Process Model :
    - Waterfall : linear sequential model
    - Incremental Process Model
    - Evolutionary Process Model
    - Unified Process for Object Oriented system

Waterfall Model :
    - Strict linear Model. Only forward arrows.
    - Problem requirement is fully understood.
    - Complex structures have well-defined systems.
    - Reflects good engineering practices

Incremental Process Model :
    - Requirements are reasonably understood.
    - provide limited Functionality to users quickly
    - Refine and expand in later releases
    - Deliver increments of software.
    Adv :
        - Customer Value due to easily releases
        - Early increments : helps elicit requirements for later increments
        - Low project failure risk
        - highest priority system services
        - Smaller teams could execute the model.

Evolutionary Process Model :
    - Requirements evolve as product progress
    - Iterative model
    Prototyping Model :
        - Poorly understood requirements
        - Quick and dirty system

Spiral Model :
    - Each phases of activity is done in iterationn.
    - At end of each iteration the phases added or elimated.
    - At end of iteration a small version of product is released.

Managing Quality :
    in SDLC : 
        - Manage quality of the process used to create the work product :
            - identify stakeholders
            - create process workflow guidelines with associated checklist
            - create process review guideline with associated checklist
            - use available tools / techniques
        - Manage quality of the work product during every phase :
            - identify work product to be created
            - define template for each work product
            - create checklist to review the work product
            - review work product created - create review process guideline
            - use available tools/techniques.

Review process guideline :
    - review the product not the producer
    - set agenda
    - limit debate and rebuttal
    - Enunciate problem areas, dont attempt to solve every problem
    - take written notes
    - limit participants and insist upon preparation
    - develop checklist for each product to be reviewed.
    - Allocate resource and schedule time for review
    - training for all reviewers
    - review earlier reviews
