Quality : Quality is how well a system functions, it varies with perspective.
    Functional view :
        - how well the functions works
        - developers or users view
        - Quality at each requirement
    Non Functional view
        - Business view
        - How good the product attract revenue.

David Garwin's 5 views :
    - Transcendental View : Immediately recognizable but cannot explicitly define.
    - Users view : product fulfills user's view
    - Manufacturer's view : conforms or exceeds specification
    - Product view : compared with general product standard
    - value-based view : how much valuable it is for the customer.

# CS 2

Software Quality : An effective software process applied in a manner that creates a useful product that provides measurable value for those who producr it and those who use it.

McCall's SQ factors :
    Catagories :
        - Product operation factors : 
            correctness, operatability, reliability, efficiency, integrity and usability.
        - Product revision factor : 
            Its ability to undergo change : maintainability, flexibility, Testability
        - Product transition factors:
            Adaptability to new environments : Portability, Reusability and interoperability.

Achieving Software Quality :
    - Software engineering methods
    - Project management techniques
    - Quality Control
    - Quality Assurance

Software engineering Methods :
    - Sound practices used through all phases of SDLC
    - Completed understanding of the problem.
    - Comprehensive design
    - constructive code : applying best practices.
    - comprehensive testing.
    - Deployment strategies.
    - Effective documentation

Project management techniques : ( not much focused)
    - time estimation
    - risk analysis
    - Human centric : keeping developers efficient.

Quality Control :
    - Have quality goals
    - Intermediate products developed to contribute to final product :
        SRS documentation
        Use case diagram
        Quality specification
        code test review

Quality Assurance :
    - Solid engineering methods
    - Rational project management
    - Quality control actions
    - Enable data availability to quantify quality.


# CS 3

Measuring Quality Attributes
    - identify main Attributes
    - identify sub Attributes

Generic framework Activities :
    - Communication
    - Planning
    - Modeling
    - Construction
    - Deployment

Software Process Models :
    Perspective process model :
        - Detailed execution of 5 generic Activities
        - intented to make projects more manageable
        - better cost estimates
        - achieve required project schedule and quality
        - Carry out process more systematically.
    Agile Process Model :
        - Informal approach to software process model
        - Emphasis on Adaptability
        - Minimal software engineering work products
        -
