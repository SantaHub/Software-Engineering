T2 : Agile Project Management For Dummies, 2nd Edition : <https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/agile-project-management/9781119405696/>

## Module 1

Ref : T2. Chapter 1

### LS 1.1 : Traditional Software Development Practices

Waterfall Phases:
    - Requirement analysis
    - Design
    - Development
    - Integration
    - Testing
    - Deployment
    Has a linear flow, though Royce, in his paper had suggested the development and testing phases to be iterative.

### LS 1.2 : Need for Agile Methods

Standish Group Research :  

- Project Success  
  - 11% projects succeeded
  - 29% projects failed outright
  - 60% projects challenged constrains
- Feature Usage : Pie Chart
  - 7% Always
  - 13% Often
  - 16% Sometime
  - 19% Rarely
  - 45% Never

### LS 1.3 : Benefits of Agile Methods

Agile                          : Traditional  

- Individuals and interactions : processes and tools
- Working software             : comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration       : contract negotiation
- Responding to change         : following a plan

Empirical Control Method based on iterative adoption, making decision based on requirements :

- Unfettered Transparency
- Frequent inspection
- immediate adaption

Project management benefits :

- Project success rate : Problems are identified early.
- Scope creep : developed only when needed
- Continuous change : Kaizen

## Module 2

### LS 2.1 Iterative and incremental approach

T1 : Key motivation for iterative development

- Early risk mitigation and discovery
- Early change adoption
- Decomposes complexity
- Builds customer and team confidence early
- Early market capture
- predictability
- Time boxing (IMP)

### LS 2.2 Popular Agile Methods

T2 : The big three

Lean Values:

- Eliminate waste : Doing only whats barely sufficient
- Amplify learning : Failures are approached with learning mindset
- Deliver as late as possible : Keep your open for adaption till last moment
- Deliver as fast as possible : Manage workflows than schedules.
- Empower the team : invest in team and their tools
- Build quality in : setup quality control to the workflows
- See the whole : Identify bottlenecks and think long term

Lean Kanban :

- Visualize : visualize workflow on white board and identify the bottlenecks
- Limit work in progress (WIP) : the lesser items you work on, the faster you finish them.
- Manage flow : Manage the tasks in progress to developer ratio

Scrum :

- Daily scrum : organize the day by reviewing what had been done yesterday and work planned for the day
- Sprint : constant inspection on progress towards release goal
- sprint end : assess performance and plan adaptation

Scrum roles :

Product owner : Represent and speaks for the business needs of the project
Development team : multi-skilled team capable of doing multiple jobs on the project
Scrum master : Protects the team from org distractions, blockers and ensure scrum played properly.

Extreme Programming principles:

- Coding is the core activity
- XP teams do lots of testing
- communication between customer and programmer is direct
- Overall design considered for refactoring to improve reusability, simplicity and maintainability

## Module 3

 - Customer collaboration
 - Support and trust
 - F2F communication
 - Working Software
